Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Language: Python

ants_project: Simulation of plants vs. zombies that I learned to use classes and inheritance in Python.

hog_project: Game simulation where I learned to use simple logic statements to create a dice rolling game. Also implemented
             simple heuristics for an AI that will win 60% of the time against a basic AI. 
             
trends_project: Processes and analyzes a large list of fake tweets for their positive and negative sentiments and maps them
                to their geographical location on a map.
